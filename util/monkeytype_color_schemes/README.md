# MonkeyType Color Schemes

This directory contains a copy of CSS color scheme definitions from [MonkeyType repository](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/tree/master/frontend/static/themes). There's also this Python script that converts these into a single Rust file that contains all the color schemes.

Why? Because their website has a similarly minimalistic interface, they have a good selection, and licenses are compatible.
